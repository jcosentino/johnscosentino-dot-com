				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am from Staten Island, NY, USA.</p>
				<p>I graduated from CUNY - The 
				College of Staten Island (CSI) in 2014 with a Bachelor 
				of Science in Psychology.</p>
				<p>I briefly went to graduate school at CSI for a Master of Science in Neuroscience,
				but that did not work out for me. I decided to return to CSI for a second degree.
				I finished with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Minor in Mathematics.
				</p>
				<p>Despite a number of hurdles in life, I finished school and finally found a field
				in which I belong.</p>
				<p>I have worked multiple jobs, including but limited to positions at 
				NYC Tech Talent Pipeline, CSI, RFCUNY, Bloomberg LP, Goodwill, with more to come.
				</p>
				<p>I have experience in ReactJS, NodeJS, SQL, JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, and Python.</p>
				<p>I plan on eventually getting my Masters degree. I do not know when, in what major, 
				nor where this will be obtained. When I get the urge to, I will return to academia.</p>
				<p>In my free time I study data structures, play on my Switch, excercise, and practice guitar.</p>
				<p>My short-term goals include moving out on my own and landing a full-time position.</p>
				<p>My long-term goal is to make a major, widespread, beneficial impact on this world.</p>
				<p>I want to be admired like Steve Jobs, impactful like Linus Torvalds, and honored like FDR.</p>
